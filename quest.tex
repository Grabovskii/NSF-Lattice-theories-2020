\begin{quest}
Derive the grand canonical Gibbs distribution to see why the sum is over $N$. It bothers me, I just can't stand this formula before I see its derivation.
\end{quest}
\begin{quest}
I do not see any issue with regards to defining the Gelfand spectrum for non-commutative Banach algebras. Why is it defined only for commutative ones? Only because it appears in the set-up of G-N theorem?
\end{quest}
\begin{quest}
Does the 2nd G-N theorem require a unit? I mean, if not, then something is still mapped to the unit of the operator algebra; that doesn't look natural, but might happen.
\end{quest}
