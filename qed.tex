\section{Free Bosons}
	\subsection{Truncated Free Bosons}
	We have here one site with Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_M$ of dimension $M$,  and basis $\{|0\rangle, |1\rangle, \cdots, |M-1\rangle\}$.
	We should here say $|0\rangle_M$, $|1\rangle_M$, etc, but will omit the extra subindex for clarity.
	We define creation $a^\dagger$ and destruction operators\footnote{Have checked that they are indeed adjoint to each other even in the truncated case.} $a$, (they should really be $a_M$ and $a^\dagger_M$ but will omit the subindex)
	such that $a|0\rangle=0$ (the zero of the Hilbert space), $a|n\rangle=\sqrt{n}|n-1\rangle$ for all $0<n<M$, 
	$a^\dagger|n\rangle=\sqrt{n+1}|n+1\rangle$ for all $0\le n < M - 1$, $a^\dagger|M-1\rangle=0$.
	Let $H:=H_M:=M^{-1}a^\dagger a$ be the ``Hamiltonian'' operator for free bosons.
	Then $H$ is self-adjoint, every element of the basis is an eigenvector of $H$, and with eigenvalues\footnote{Indeed, $H|0\rangle = 0$ and for $M-1 \geq m > 0$ we have $H|m \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{m}\sqrt{m}}{M}$. } $\{0, 1/M, 2/M, \cdots, (M-1)/M\}$.
	
	Consider the the algebra $\mathcal{U}_M$ generated by $a$ and $a^\dagger$ and the identity $I$. $H$ belongs to this algebra. It's a $C^*$-algebra (even a von Neumann algebra): we included in the list of generators all conjugates and we supplied the algebra with the operator norm, which always satisfies the $C^*$-identity. It's a von Neumann algebra because any finite-dimensional $C^*$-algebra is a von Neumann algebra.
	
Regarding the dimension, it's clear to me that the algebra is finite-dimensional and that the dimension can be bounded from below by $3M-2$. I haven't figured out yet the exact dimension.

	\subsection{Infinite Free Bosons}
		We have here  one site with separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ of infinite dimension,  and basis $\{|0\rangle, |1\rangle, \cdots\}$; 
	we define creation $a^\dagger$ and destruction operators $a$,
	such that $a|0\rangle=0$, $a|n\rangle=\sqrt{n}|n-1\rangle$ for all $0<n$, 
	$a^\dagger|n\rangle=\sqrt{n+1}|n+1\rangle$ for all $0\le n$. Notice that both $a$ and $a^\dagger$ are unbounded but their domains are dense in $\mathcal H_{\infty}$.
	
	\begin{statement}
	The approach with energy density does not work. Precisely, the following is true: for every $M \geq 1$, extend $H_M = \frac{1}{M} a_M^\dagger a_M$ to act on $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ by setting it equal to zero on the orthogonal complement of $\mathcal H_{M} \subset \mathcal H_{\infty}$. Then there is a well defined limit in the strong topology: $H_{\infty}|\psi \rangle = \lim_{M \rightarrow \infty} H_{M}|\psi \rangle$. However, $H_{\infty} = 0$.
	\end{statement}
	\begin{proof}
	Indeed, for any basis ket $|k\rangle$, we have $\lim_{M \rightarrow} H_M|k\rangle = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}(k/M)|k\rangle = 0$, so the sequence $H_M$ converges strongly to zero.
	\end{proof}
	\begin{statement}
	Redefine $H_M$ as $H_M := a_M^\dagger a_M$ and extend by zero onto the orthogonal complement of $\mathcal H_{M}$, so $H_M |k \rangle = k |k\rangle$ for $k \leq M-1$. Then $H_M$ converges strongly to some unbounded self-adjoint (hence closed) operator $H_{\infty}$ on a dense subspace of $\mathcal H_{\infty}$.
	\end{statement}
	\begin{proof}
The domain of $H_{\infty}$ would be the dense subspace
\[
\Dom H_{\infty} = \{ |\psi\rangle = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \psi_k |k \rangle \in \mathcal H_{\infty} \ | \ \sum_{k=0}^\infty k |\psi_k| < \infty \}.
\]
So, for any $|\psi\rangle$ such that $\sum_{k=0}^\infty k |\psi_k| < \infty$, we can safely define\footnote{It's a general fact from the theory of Banach spaces that a series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty x_k$ converges iff the series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \|x_k\|$ converges.}
\[
H_{\infty}|\psi \rangle :=\lim_{M \rightarrow \infty} H_{M}|\psi \rangle = \sum_{k=0}^\infty k\psi_k |k \rangle.
\]
The operator is clearly unbounded, for $\|H_{\infty}|k\rangle\| \rightarrow \infty$.

Now let's find the domain of $H_{\infty}^\dagger$. By definition of the adjoint of an unbounded operator, $|\phi \rangle \in \Dom (H_{\infty}^\dagger)$ if and only if there exists $|\theta\rangle \in \mathcal H_{\infty}$ such that for every $|\psi \rangle \in \Dom(H_{\infty})$ we have $\left\langle \phi | H_{\infty} | \psi \right\rangle = \langle \theta | \psi \rangle$. In components, this equality means that $\phi_k^* \psi_k k = \theta_k^* \psi_k$, hence $|\phi\rangle$ must reside in $\Dom(H_\infty)$. Since $H_{\infty}$ is obviously symmetric and $\Dom(H_{\infty}) = \Dom(H_{\infty}^\dagger)$, it is self-adjoint. From the general theory of unbounded operators we know that the adjoint is always closed, hence any $H_{\infty} = H_{\infty}^\dagger$ is closed.
	\end{proof}
	
	
	%For every $M\ge 1$ we extend $H_M$ to act  Since the norm of $H_M$ on $\mathcal H_{M}$ is equal to $(M-1)/M$, such is the norm of the extension as well.
	The limit (in operator norm, weak, strong?) of the sequence of operators $H_M$ exits (?), is unique, and let's call it $H_\infty$.
	Then $H_\infty$ is self adjoint (is it really?) and its spectrum is $\sigma(H_\infty) = [0, 1)$ (does it include 1?).
    Moreover, every $1/n$ for $n>=1$ is an eigenvalue of $H_\infty$, and the corresponding eigenvectors form a basis of $\mathcal{H}_\infty$.
    
	For $P\ge 1$, let  $v_P,\,w_P$ be both vectors in $\mathcal{H}_P$, and consider their extension to any $M\ge P$ by the same name. 
	then $lim_{M\rightarrow\infty} \langle v_P | H_M | w_P\rangle$ exists, and is equal to
	$\langle v_P | H_\infty | w_P\rangle$, where $v_P,\,w_P$ are considered vectors of $\mathcal{H}_\infty$.
	
Consider the algebra $\mathcal{U}_\infty$ generated by $a$ and $a^\dagger$ and the identity $I$. Does $H_\infty$ belong to this algebra?
What's the dimension of this algebra? Is this a C* algebra? Is it a von Neumann algebra? Etc.
	Is this algebra a limit in some sense from the sequence of algebras $\mathcal{U}_M$.
	
	\section{Free Fermions}
	\subsection{Finite Chain}
	Consider one site with Hilbert space of dimension two,  and basis $\{|0\rangle, |1\rangle\}$; physically we say
	that the state $|0\rangle$ is empty, and the state $|1\rangle$ occupied;
	we define creation $c^\dagger$ and destruction operators $c$,
	such that $c|0\rangle=0$, $c|1\rangle=|0\rangle$, $c^\dagger|0\rangle=|1\rangle$, $c^\dagger|1\rangle=0$.
	For $N$ sites, we extend the definitions by making $N$ tensor products, so that the total dimension is $2^N$.
	(Even though we use the word \emph{site} or \emph{sites}, we use here momentum space for simplicity, 
	so that the $H$ below will be already in ``diagonal form.'')
	Given a $N-$tensor product state $|v\rangle\equiv|v_0\rangle\otimes|v_1\rangle\otimes\cdots\otimes|v_{N-1}\rangle$, 
	the $v_m$ are either $0$ or $1$. Let the parity up to 
	$m$ operator $P_m$ be the diagonal operator such that  $P_m|v\rangle = p(|v\rangle, m)|v\rangle$, where
	$p(|v\rangle, m)$ is the number $1$ or $-1$, and is given by 
	\begin{equation}
	p(|v\rangle, m)\equiv(-1)^{\sum_{0\le m'<m} v_{m'}}.
	\end{equation}
	In other words, $P_m |v \rangle$ is $|v\rangle$ if the number of $|1\rangle$ strictly preceding $m$th position is even; $-|v\rangle$ if odd.
	
	We write $d_m$ to mean $I\otimes I\otimes\cdots \otimes c \otimes I \otimes \cdots\otimes I$, where $c$ is at location $m$,
	and $I$ is the one site identity. We write $c_m (N) \equiv d_m P_m$, where $P_m$ is the parity operator up to $m$, as defined before.
	Note that $c_m (N)$ acts on the full space $\{|0\rangle, |1\rangle\}^{\otimes N}$. \emph{I drop now the $(N)$ from the $c_m$.}
	
	\begin{example}
Let $|w\rangle=|0\rangle\otimes|1\rangle\otimes|1\rangle\otimes|0\rangle\cdots$, and remember that we count locations from $0$.
	Then $c_2|w\rangle=-|0\rangle\otimes|1\rangle\otimes|0\rangle\otimes|0\rangle\otimes\cdots$, with a -1 because the sum of 1s before location 2 is odd.
	On the other hand $c^\dagger_3|w\rangle = |0\rangle\otimes|1\rangle\otimes|1\rangle\otimes|1\rangle\otimes\cdots$, with a +1 because
	the sum of 1s before location 3 is even. Obviously  $c_2^\dagger|w\rangle = c_3|w\rangle = 0$ as we can't destroy if there's no particle,
	and we can't create if there's already a particle, because these are fermions and accept only one particle per location.
	\end{example}
	 
	We write $c^\dagger_m c_m$ to mean the tensor product operator with $c^\dagger$ and $c$ at location $m$, 
	identities elsewhere, \emph{and with appropriate parities,} so it's $P_m d^\dagger_m  d_m P_m$. (Careful that $P_m$ and $d_m$ or $d^\dagger_m$ do not commute.)
	Let 
	\begin{equation}
	H_N=N^{-1}\sum_{m=0}^{m=N-1} e_m c^\dagger_m c_m
	\end{equation} be the ``Hamiltonian'' operator for free fermions, where $e_m = -2\cos(2\pi m/N)$ for $0\le m < N$ integers;
	this is called the \emph{dispersion} relation for free periodic fermions.
	Then $H_N$ is a self-adjoint (symmetric) matrix of rank $2^N$.
	
	\subsubsection{Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian}
	All this is just matrix diagonalization, but because of the form of the $2^N$ matrix $H$, we can find its
	eigenvalues and eigenvectors in a compact way, that we know how to describe.
	
	Let $S = \{ f: \{0, 1, \cdots, N - 1\} \rightarrow \{0, 1\}\}$, that can be thought of as binary numbers with $N$ digits.
	There are $2^N$ functions $f$ in $S$ and for each, the number
	$N^{-1}\sum_{m=0}^{m < N} f(m) e_m$ is an eigenvalue of $H_N$ with eigenvector
	\[
	\bigotimes_{m\in I(f)}c^\dagger_{m}|0\rangle,
	\]
	 where $I(f) = \{m\in\{0, 1, \cdots, N - 1\}; f(m) = 1\}$,  
	and $|0\rangle = |0\rangle\otimes|0\rangle\cdots|0\rangle$ the fully ``empty'' state.
 	 In particular, the lowest eigenvector of $H_N$ is
 	 \[
 	 \bigotimes_{m\in I_{min}}c^\dagger_{m}|0\rangle,
 	 \]
 	 with eigenvalue $N^{-1}\sum_{m \in I_{min}} e_m$, where $I_{min} = \{m; 0\le m \le N/(8\pi)\}\cup\{m; 3N/(8\pi)\le m < N\}$.
 	
 	 Exercise: Express the largest eigenvector and eigenvalue to make sure you understand the construction.
 	 
 	 \subsubsection{Fermionic Density}
 	 Let $D_N=N^{-1}\sum_{m=0}^{m < N} c^\dagger_m c_m$ be the density operator. Then $D_N$ is self-adjoint, diagonal, and
 	 with eigenvalues $\{0, 1/N, 2/N, \cdots, 1\}$. Moreover, $D_N$ and $H_N$ commute (physically, $H_N$ ``conserves'' the particle density
 	 or the number of particles), and the eigenvector of $H_N$ characterized by $f\in S$, is also an eigenvector of $D_N$
 	 with eigenvalue equal to the number of elements of $I(f)$ divided by $N$.
 	 
 	 Consider the algebra $\mathcal{U}_M$ generated by $c_m$ (with parity and in the $2^N$ space) and $c^\dagger_m$ and the identity $I$.
 	 $H_N$ and $D_N$ belong to this algebra.
 	 What's the dimension of this algebra? Is this a C* algebra? Is it a von Neumann algebra? Etc.
 	 
 	 \subsection{Infinite Chain}
 	 We have here a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ of infinite dimension,  and basis $\{|0\rangle, |1\rangle, \cdots\}$.
 	 	For every $M\ge 1$ we extend $H_M$ to act on $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ (does this extension make sense?).
 	 		The limit (in operator norm, weak, strong?) of the sequence of operators $H_M$ exits (?), is unique, and let's call it $H_\infty$.
 	 	Then $H_\infty$ is self adjoint (is it really?) and its spectrum is $\sigma(H_\infty) = [-2/\pi, 2/\pi]$.
 	 	
 	 	What are the eigenvalues (if any) and eigenvectors of $H_\infty$?
 	 	
 	 	Let $D_\infty$ be the corresponding limit of the $D_N$ operators. Show it's self-adjoint with spectrum $\sigma(D_\infty) = [0, 1]$.
 	 	What are the eigenvalues (if any) and eigenvectors of $D_\infty$?
 	 	
 	 Consider the algebra $\mathcal{U}_\infty$ generated by $c_i$ and $c^\dagger_i$ and the identity $I$ with some completion.
 	 How does one ``complete'' or ``close'' this algebra?
 	 Does $H_\infty$ belong to this algebra? What about $D_\infty$?
 	 What's the dimension of this algebra? Is this a C* algebra? Is it a von Neumann algebra? Etc.
 	 Is this algebra a limit in some sense from the sequence of algebras $\mathcal{U}_N$.
