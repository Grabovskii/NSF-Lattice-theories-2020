\subsection{$C^*$-algebras}
Recall the definition of a $C^*$-algebra:
\begin{definition}
A (unital) $C^*$-algebra $A$ is a Banach space over $\mathbb C$ that is also a (unital) algebra such that the multiplication is a bounded bilinear map of norm $1$. It's also supplied with an involution\footnote{An involution has the same properties as the usual conjugation operators. So, $(a+b)^* = a^* + b^*$, $(\lambda a)^* = \lambda^* a^*$, $1^* = 1$, $(ab)^* = b^* a^*$, $(a^*)^* = a$.} $*:A\rightarrow A$ such that $\|a^*a\| = \|a\|^2$ for all $a \in A$. 
\end{definition}
A straightforward\footnote{From the boundedness of the multiplication we obtain $\|a\|^2 = \|a^*a\| \leq \|a^*\|\|a\|$, hence $\|a\| \leq \|a\|^*$. Switching to $a \mapsto a^*$, get $\|a\| = \|a\|^*$. For the unit, $\|1\| = \|1\|^2$ since $1^* = 1$.} consequence from the axioms is that $\|a\| = \|a^*\|$ and in the unital case $\|1\| = 1$.

\subsubsection{Gelfand-Naymark: commutative case}
I think it worth mentioning:
\begin{theorem}
(Gelfand-Naymark, 1st) We have the following:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Any possibly non-unital commutative $C^*$-algebra is isomorphic to the space $C_0(\Omega)$ of continuous functions vanishing\footnote{Precisely, a function $\varphi : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb C$ is vanishing at infinity if for any $\varepsilon >0$ there exists a compact subset $\Delta \subseteq \Omega$ such that $|\phi(t)|< \varepsilon$ when $t \notin \Delta$.} at $\infty$ on some locally compact Hausdorff topological space $\Omega$;
\item Any unital commutative $C^*$-algebra is isomorphic to $C(\Omega)$ for $\Omega$ a compact Hausdorff space.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

There's an accurate description of both the isomorphism and the space $\Omega$: the space $\Omega$ is the Gelfand spectrum of $A$, and the isomorphism is the Gelfand representation.

Here are the definitions. Let $A$ be a Banach algebra\footnote{I.e. a Banach space that's also an algebra such that the multiplication is a bounded bilinear map with norm $1$.}. Its \emph{Gelfand spectrum} is the space $\Omega \subset A^*$ of all characters\footnote{A character is a non-zero linear functional that preserves the multiplication. It turns out that any character $\chi : A \rightarrow \mathbb C$ has norm $\|\chi\| \leq 1$, so they're automatically continuous, for if $\chi(a) = 1$ for some $a \in A$ with $\|a\| <1$, then let $b:=\sum_{k=1}^\infty a^k$. It follows that $a + ab = b$, hence $1 + \chi(b) = \chi(b)$, which is absurd. } of $A$  that is endowed with $\omega^*$-topology induced from $A^*$. The isomorphism then is the Gelfand representation $\Gamma_A : A \rightarrow C_0(\Omega)$ that sends an element $a \in A$ to a continuous map (vanishing at $\infty$) $\hat a$ such that\footnote{The continuity of $\hat a$ follows right from the definition of $\omega^*$-topology. It indeed vanishes at $\infty$, for $\hat a$ is a continuous map on the compactification $\Omega^\prime := \Omega \cup \{0\}$ such that $\hat{a}(0) = 0$ (look at the formula defining $\hat{a}$), hence for any $\varepsilon > 0$ there's $U_{\varepsilon} \ni 0$ such that $|\hat{a}(\chi)| < \varepsilon$ when $t \in U_{\varepsilon}$. But $U_{\varepsilon}^c$ is compact, as a closed subset of the compact space $\Omega^\prime$, so $\hat a$ vanishes at $\infty$.}
\begin{proposition}
The Gelfand spectrum $\Omega$ of a Banach algebra $A$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space; if $A$ is in addition unital, then $\Omega$ is Hausdorff and compact.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Obviously, $\Omega$ is Hausdorff since $\omega^*$-topology is Hausdorff. Consider $\Omega^\prime := \Omega \cup \{0\}$. If $\chi_\alpha \rightarrow f$ in $\omega^*$-topology, then obviously $f$ preserves multiplication (but it might become zero), so $\Omega^\prime$ is a closed subset of the unit ball in $A^*$. Now it's the consequence of Banach-Alaoglu theorem that $\Omega^\prime$ is compact. Being a closed subset of a compact Hausdorff space, we see that $\Omega$ is locally compact and Hausdorff. In case $A$ is unital, $0$ is an isolated point of $\Omega^\prime$, for if there was a net $\chi_\alpha \in \Omega$ such that $\chi_\alpha \rightarrow 0$, then $1 = \chi_\alpha(1) \rightarrow 0$, which is a contradiction, and thus $\Omega$ is compact.
\end{proof}
The beauty of the result and the proof are mesmerizing, so I couldn't resist working out the details. Here I'd like to record a sketch for the unital case (the non-unital has to come from the unital by the process of adjoining an identity). One can find a full proof in \cite{arveson}.
\begin{proof}[Sketch of the proof of the 1st G-F theorem.]
First of all, in case of $C^*$-algebras it is automatic that every character preserves the $\ast$-structure. This fact implies that $\Gamma_A$ is a unital $\ast$-homomorphism. Next, one shows that the spectrum $\sigma(a)$ of any $a \in A$ coincides with the range of $\hat{a}$. Indeed, $\lambda \in \sigma(a)$ if and only if $a-\lambda$ is not invertbile, if and only if $a-\lambda$ belongs to some maximal ideal; there is a $1-1$ correspondence between maximal ideals and characters in unital commutative Banach algebras, so we find $\chi$ such that $\chi(a-\lambda) = \lambda$, i.e., $\hat{a}(\chi) = \lambda$. A consequence of this is that the spectral radius $r(a)$ of any $a$ coincides with the norm of $\hat{a}$. Now, if $a$ is self-adjoint, then $\|a\| = r(a) = \|\hat{a}\|$, which means that $\Gamma_A$ works as an isometry on self-adjoint elements. If $a \in A$ is an arbitrary one, then we use the $C^*$-structure and the fact that $a^*a$ is self-adjoint:
\[
\|a\|^2 = \|a^* a\| = \|\hat{a}^* \hat{a}\| = \|\hat{a}\|^2.
\]
Thus $\Gamma_A$ is an isometric embedding. Its image is a closed subalgebra and contains the identity of $C(\Omega)$. For surjectivity, one applies the Stone-Weierstrass theorem: the functions $\hat{a}$ separate the points (for two different $\chi_1 \neq \chi_2$, just take any $a \in \Ker \chi_1 \setminus \Ker \chi_2$, and then $0 = \hat{a}(\chi_1) \neq \hat{a}(\chi_2)$).
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{States, pure states, and associated representations}
There's a construction that associates a representation to a state, which is called the Gelfand-Segal construction.

\subsubsection{Gelfand-Naymark: non-commutative case}
For possibly non-commutative $C^*$-algebras we have 
\begin{theorem}
(Gelfand-Naymark, 2nd) Any unital $C^*$-algebra is $*$-isometrically isomorphic to $\End(H)$ for some Hilbert space $H$.
\end{theorem}

\subsubsection{Properties of AF algebras (not finished)}
\begin{definition}
A (unital) $C^*$-algebra $A$ is called \emph{approximately finite-dimensional} if $A$ is an inductive limit of a sequence of finite-dimensional (unital) $C^*$-algebras.
\end{definition}
I'd like to record some interesting properties of such algebras. They may not be important for our purposes, though. An example of an AF algebra appearing in these notes is the space of observables attached to an infinite sublattice when a Hilbert space at a single site is finite-dimensional.
\begin{proposition} (see \cite{bratteli})
Let $A$ be a unital $C^*$-algebra. Then $A$ is an AF-algebra if and only if the following two conditions are fullfilled:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $A$ is separable;
\item If $x_1,\ldots,x_n \in A$ and $\varepsilon > 0$, then there exist a finite-dimensional $C^*$-subalgebra $B \subseteq A$ and elements $y_1,\ldots,y_n \in B$ such that $\|x_i-y_i\| < \varepsilon$, $i=1,\ldots,n$.
\end{enumerate}
Furthermore, if $A$ is AF, and $A_1$ is a finite-dimensional $C^*$-subalgebra of $A$, there exists an increasing sequence $A_2 \subseteq A_3 \subseteq \cdots $ of finite-dimensional $C^*$-subalgebras such that $A_1 \subseteq A_2$ and $A = \bigcup_{i}A_i$.
\end{proposition}
Some aspects of the statement are not clear to me, and if needed, can delve into: so, the closure is not taken in the second bullet, is this right?

A couple of interesting results on pure states:
\begin{proposition}(see \cite{bratteli})
Let $A$ be an AF-algebra and let $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ be pure states of $A$ such that the associated representations $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ are faithful. Then there exists an automorphism $\alpha$ of $A$ such that $\omega_1 = \omega_2 \circ \alpha$.
\end{proposition}
The next proposition is basically saying that a state is pure iff its restriction to each finite-dimensional subalgebra is pure.
\begin{proposition}(see \cite{bratteli})
Let $A$ be an AF-algebra and let $\omega$ be a state of $A$ such that the associated representation is faithful. Then $\omega$ is pure if and only if there exists an increasing subsequence $A_n$ of finite-dimensional $\ast$-subalgebras of $A$ all containing the identity and such that $A = \varinjlim A_n$ and $\omega | A_n$ is pure for all $n$.
\end{proposition}
